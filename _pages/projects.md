    <br>
    <p class="white">
    <b>ARENA</b> is an interdisciplinary research project aimed at better understanding how (conceptual-semantic) knowledge is organized at different levels of abstraction â€“ both in the brain as well as in AI models, and both in the form of concrete visual objects as well as in their linguistic representation. A central part of this research endeavor is to understand </p> 
    <ul class="white">
    <li>How abstract representations are learned.</li>
    <li>How these representations are mapped onto decisions in various task contexts.</li>
    <li>Whether and how these representations are coded in neural activity elicited during human perception.</li>

    <h2 class="projname">DRYHADS </h2>
    <br>
    <p class="white">
    <b>DRYHADS</b> Our research group studies the brain bases of higher cognitive functions such as language, working memory, cognitive control, goal-directed behavior. To this end, we use modern brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, EEG, or magnetoencephalography. Our work aims at understanding basic mechanisms of cognition, but also individual differences in cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence or working memory capacity. </p>
