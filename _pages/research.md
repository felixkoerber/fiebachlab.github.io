# Main Research Topics in Our Lab

Our research group studies the brain bases of higher cognitive functions such as language, working memory, cognitive control, goal-directed behavior. To this end, we use modern brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, EEG, or magnetoencephalography. Our work aims at understanding basic mechanisms of cognition, but also individual differences in cognitive abilities, such as general intelligence or working memory capacity.

 
## Cognitive Stability and Cognitive Flexibility

- working memory, working memory capacity, working memory precision

- task switching

- distractor inhibition

- dopaminergic control of stability vs. flexibility

 
## Language Processing

- predictive coding during language processing (L-POP project funded by ERC)

- word recognition

- reading and reading disorders

- Speech dynamics
- Hierarchical information encoding  


 
## Neurobiological Mechanisms underlying Individual Differences

- brain bases of intelligence

- effects of personality (esp. anxiety) on executive cognitive control

- individual differences in working memory capacity

- genes, brain, and behavior

- neurocognitive development of reading, attention, executive control

## Other

- Neurocomputational approaches to brain-body interactions (eye movements, respiration, heart-rate)
- Neural oscillations in auditory sequence processing
- Predictive modelling in audition 
- Neural variability
